SOLUTION ==> [Weekly Contest 238]

In base conversion, dividing by k shifts the number right by one digit and the remainder is the removed digit.
Summing remainders gives the sum of digits in that base.

class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int rem;

        while(n > 0){
            rem = n % k;
            sum += rem;
            n /= k;   
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
